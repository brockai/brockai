    "# Demo Notebook for Sentence Transformer Model Training, Saving and Uploading to OpenSearch\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [Download notebook](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-py-ml/blob/main/docs/source/examples/demo_transformer_model_train_save_upload_to_openSearch.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces the technique of synthetic data generation and how it can be used to obtain a deep learning model for Search that is custom built for a given set of documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning models are very powerful and have been shown to improve state of the art in several disciplines and tasks. However, they need a lot of labelled training data. Such data is often hard to obtain.  In this notebook, we show how pre-trained large language models can be used to circumvent this issue. \n",
    "\n",
    "We focus on the task of passage retrieval i.e the corpus consists of passages which is searched at run-time given a user query. This search can be performed by transformers such as BERT as long as BERT is trained on a labelled dataset that consists of pairs such as (queries, relevant passage). Such a BERT model can be used for semantic search. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Synthetic query generation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the absence of such labelled data we provide a synthetic query generator (SQG) model that can be used to create synthetic queries given a passage. The SQG model is a large transformer model that has been trained to generate human like queries given a passage. Thus it can be used to create a labelled dataset of (synthetic queries, passage). A BERT model can be trained on this synthetic data and used for semantic search. In fact, we find that such synthetically trained models beat the current state-of-the-art models. Note that resulting BERT model is a customized model since it has been trained on a specific corpus (and corresponding synthetic queries).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an end-to-end guide for users to generate synthetic queries and fine-tune a sentence transformer model on it using opensearch_py_ml. It consists of the following steps,\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Import packages and set up client\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Import the data/passages for synthetic query generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Generate Synthetic Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Read synthetic queries and train/fine-tune model using a hugging face sentence transformer model\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5: Upload the model to OpenSearch cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps 3 and 4 are compute intensive step, and we recommend running it on a machine with 4 or more GPUS such as the EC2 `p3.8xlarge` or `p3.16xlarge`."

    "    1) Convert the data into a form that can be consumed by the Synthetic query generator (SQG) model. This amounts to tokenizing the data using a tokenizer. The SQG model is a fine-tuned version of the GPT-XL model https://huggingface.co/gpt2-xl and the tokenizer is the GPT tokenizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2) The tokenizer has a max input length of 512 tokens. Every passage is tokenized with the special tokens <|startoftext|> and QRY: appended to the beginning and the end of every passage respectively. Note that tokenization is a time intensive process and the script saves the tokenized data after the first pass. We recommend setting tokenize_data = False subsequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3) Load the SQG model i.e. 1.5B parameter GPT2-XL model that has been trained to ask questions given passages. This model has been made publicly available and can be found here: https://artifacts.opensearch.org/models/ml-models/amazon/gpt/GPT2_xl_sqg/1.0.0/GPT2_xl_sqg.zip\n",
    "\n",
    "    4) Once the model has been loaded and the data has been tokenized, the model starts the process of query generation. \"total_queries\" is number of synthetic queries generated for every passage and \"numseq\" is the number of queries that are generated by a model at a given time. Ideally total_queries = numseq, but this can lead to out of memory issues. So set numseq to an integer that is around 10 or less, and is a divisor of total_queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5) tokens_to_word_ratio is a float variable that is used to switch between length of a document in tokens vs. in words. It is used when truncating documents during the tokenization phase. Most words are split in to one or more tokens. A document that has a length of 300 tokens might only be 200 words long. This ratio of 200/300 = 2/3 = 0.667 is the tokens_to_word_ratio. For passages from a dataset such as Wikipedia this ratio is around 0.65 to 0.7, but for domain specific datasets this ratio could be as small as 0.5.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    6) The script also requires to know the number of GPUs and the number of machines/nodes that it can use. Since we are using a single node instance with no GPUs we pass 0 and 1 to the function respectively. Our recommended setting is to use 1 machine/node with at least 4 (ideally 8) GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    7) The script now begins to generate queries and displays a progress bar. We create total_queries per passage. Empirically we find that generating more queries leads to better performance but there are diminishing returns since the total inference time increases with total_queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "    8) After generating the queries, the function uses a publicly available package called Detoxify to remove inappropriate queries from the dataset. \"toxic_cutoff\" is a float. The script rejects all queries that have a toxicity score greater than toxic_cutoff\n",
    "\n",
    "    9) Finally, the synthetic queries along with their corresponding passages are saved in a zipped file in the current working directory.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The input to the training script consists of (query, passage) pairs. The model is trained to maximize the dot product between relevant queries and passages while at the same time minimize the dot product between queries and irrelevant passages. This is also known as contrastive learning. We implement this using in-batch negatives and a symmetric loss as mentioned below. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. To utilize the power of GPUs we collect training samples into a batch before sending for model training. Each batch contains B number of randomly selected training samples (q, p). Thus within a batch each query has one relevant passage and B-1 irrelevant passages. Similarly for every passage there's one relevant query and B-1 irrelevant queries. For every given relevant query and passage pair we minimize the following expression, called the loss, \n",
    "\n",
    "3. For a given batch B, the loss is defined as loss = C(q, p) + C(p, q) where $C(q, p) = - \\sum_{i=1}^{i=B} \\log \\left( \\frac{exp(q_i \\cdot p_i)}{\\sum_{j=1} ^{B} exp(q_i \\cdot p_j)}\\right)$   \n",
    "\n",
    "4. The model truncates documents beyond 512 tokens. If the corpus contains documents that are shorter than 512 tokens the model max length can be adjusted to that number. Shorter sequences take less memory and therefore allow for bigger batch sizes. The max length can be adjusted by the \"percentile\" argument.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. We use a batch size of 32 per device. Larger batch sizes lead to more in-batch negative samples and lead to better performance but unfortunately they also lead to out of memory issues. Shorter sequences use less memory, so if the document corpus is short feel free to experiment with larger batch sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The model is trained using the AdamW optimizer for 10 epochs with a learning rate of 2e-5 and a scheduler with linear schedule with warmup steps = 10,000"
