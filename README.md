# Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence Prototypes

Hi I'm Brock,

This repo is used to build out Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) prototypes that can be added to desktop and mobile apps. You can see it in action at <a href="https://brockai.com" target="_blank">brockai.com</a>.

### Birch Mountain Enterprises Fuel Delivery

BME provide fuel delivery services. Their tractors are outfitted with Geotab hardware that tracks location. The app integrates with Geotab Fleet Management which provides API services for user management and tractor location. 

There are two audiences, Drivers and Administrators. Drivers are concerened with loading, scaling in/out, delivery, onboard volume and load tracking and delays. Administrators are concerned with reporting on fuel delivery, tracking fuel Onboard real-time, managing tractor access to drivers and managing driver access.
