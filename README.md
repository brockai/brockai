brockai provides a plaform where data can be ingested, preprocessed, modeled and tranined.

It is built using the SAO Stack (Streamlit - Airflow - OpenSearch)

Streamlit - An open-source Python library that makes prototyping ML/AI apps quick. Just use Jupyter Notebooks like always and then paste your code directly into the app.

Airflow - An open-source platform designed to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. Code DAGs locally, then publish to host automatically for consumption.

OpenSearch - An open-source distributed search and analytics engine is a fork of ElasticSearch. OpenSearch comes with built-in security, scalable capacity and performance, search, observability, dashboards, and more.
