# Streamlit, Node, OpenSearch Experimental

Adding Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) into traditional mobile and desktop applications can provide significant advantages and open up a plethora of new possibilities.

Streamlit is a great tool, however it has been my experience that it is limited on the frontend when compared to React/VUE or Angular (I suspect that will improve over time). On the flip side, Streamlit backend integration is outstanding and is 100% python based, using Jupyter Notebooks with Streamlit is magic. 

Using OpenSearch as the database provides ML/AL compatibility, irrespective of the frontend. Using Node to build the API provides a robust, portable, proven middleware.

## Apps & Prototypes

### Birch Mountain Entrprises Fuel Delivery

BME provide fuel delivery services. Their tractors are outfitted with Geotab hardware that tracks location. The app integrates with Geotab Fleet Management which provides API services for user management and tractor location. 

There are two audiences, Drivers and Administrators. Drivers are concerened with loading, scaling in/out, delivery, onboard volume and load tracking and delays. Administrators are concerned with reporting on fuel delivery, tracking fuel Onboard real-time, managing tractor access to drivers and managing driver access.
