👋 Hi, I’m @brockai,
  
👀 I am interested building Huggingface open source Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications deployed in the browser or as secure APIs.

🌱 I’m working on building an API and frontend with search capability to analyze Bill of Material components to make predictions on compliancy.
  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that could benefit from the addition Huggingface NLP and/or api application to enhance the user experience and enable powerful text-based functionalities.
