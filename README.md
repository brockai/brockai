# Streamlit, Node, OpenSearch Experimental

Adding Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) into traditional mobile and desktop applications can provide significant advantages and open up a plethora of new possibilities.

Streamlit is a great tool, however it has been my experience that it is limited on the frontend when compared to React/VUE or Angular (I suspect that will improve over time). On the flip side, Streamlit backend integration is outstanding and is 100% python based, using Jupyter Notebooks with Streamlit is magic. 

Using OpenSearch as the database provides ML/AL compatibility, irrespective of the frontend. Using Node to build the API provides a robust, portable, proven middleware.
